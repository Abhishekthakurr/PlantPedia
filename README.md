**Plant Leaf Disease Classification using Machine Learning and React.js**

Welcome to the Plant Leaf Disease Classification project repository!

### Overview
This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant diseases by analyzing images of plant leaves. By employing machine learning techniques, we can accurately classify various types of diseases affecting plant leaves. Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly web interface built with React.js, allowing users to upload images and receive instant disease classification results.

### Features
- **Image Classification**: Utilizes machine learning models to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories.
- **User Interface**: Provides a sleek and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Real-time Results**: Delivers instant classification results upon uploading images, enhancing efficiency in disease diagnosis.
- **Accessibility**: Accessible to farmers and agricultural professionals for quick and reliable disease identification, aiding in timely treatment.
